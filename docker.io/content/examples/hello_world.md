# Check your Docker install

This guide assumes you have a working installation of Docker. To check
your Docker install, run the following command:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
# Check that you have a working install
$ sudo docker info
~~~~

If you get `docker: command not found` or something like
`/var/lib/docker/repositories: permission denied` you may have an
incomplete Docker installation or insufficient privileges to access
docker on your machine.

Please refer to installation\_list for installation instructions.

# Hello World

This is the most basic example available for using Docker.

Download the small base image named `busybox`:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
# Download a busybox image
$ sudo docker pull busybox
~~~~

The `busybox` image is a minimal Linux system. You can do the same with
any number of other images, such as `debian`, `ubuntu` or `centos`. The
images can be found and retrieved using the [Docker index][].

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
$ sudo docker run busybox /bin/echo hello world
~~~~

This command will run a simple `echo` command, that will echo
`hello world` back to the console over standard out.

**Explanation:**

-   **"sudo"** execute the following commands as user *root*
-   **"docker run"** run a command in a new container
-   **"busybox"** is the image we are running the command in.
-   **"/bin/echo"** is the command we want to run in the container
-   **"hello world"** is the input for the echo command

# Hello World Daemon

And now for the most boring daemon ever written!

We will use the Ubuntu image to run a simple hello world daemon that
will just print hello world to standard out every second. It will
continue to do this until we stop it.

**Steps:**

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
CONTAINER_ID=$(sudo docker run -d ubuntu /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done")
~~~~

We are going to run a simple hello world daemon in a new container made
from the `ubuntu` image.

-   **"sudo docker run -d "** run a command in a new container. We pass
    "-d" so it runs as a daemon.
-   **"ubuntu"** is the image we want to run the command inside of.
-   **"/bin/sh -c"** is the command we want to run in the container
-   **"while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"** is the mini
    script we want to run, that will just print hello world once a
    second until we stop it.
-   **\$CONTAINER\_ID** the output of the run command will return a
    container id, we can use in future commands to see what is going on
    with this process.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
sudo docker logs $CONTAINER_ID
~~~~

Check the logs make sure it is working correctly.

-   **"docker logs**" This will return the logs for a container
-   **\$CONTAINER\_ID** The Id of the container we want the logs for.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
sudo docker attach -sig-proxy=false $CONTAINER_ID
~~~~

Attach to the container to see the results in real-time.

-   **"docker attach**" This will allow us to attach to a background
    process to see what is going on.
-   **"-sig-proxy=false"** Do not forward signals to the container;
    allows us to exit the attachment using Control-C without stopping
    the container.
-   **\$CONTAINER\_ID** The Id of the container we want to attach too.

Exit from the container attachment by pressing Control-C.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
sudo docker ps
~~~~

Check the process list to make sure it is running.

-   **"docker ps"** this shows all running process managed by docker

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
sudo docker stop $CONTAINER_ID
~~~~

Stop the container, since we don't need it anymore.

-   **"docker stop"** This stops a container
-   **\$CONTAINER\_ID** The Id of the container we want to stop.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
sudo docker ps
~~~~

Make sure it is really stopped.
