# Binaries

**This instruction set is meant for hackers who want to try out Docker
on a variety of environments.**

Before following these directions, you should really check if a packaged
version of Docker is already available for your distribution. We have
packages for many distributions, and more keep showing up all the time!

## Check runtime dependencies

To run properly, docker needs the following software to be installed at
runtime:

-   iproute2 version 3.5 or later (build after 2012-05-21), and
    specifically the "ip" utility
-   iptables version 1.4 or later
-   The LXC utility scripts (<http://lxc.sourceforge.net>) version 0.8
    or later
-   Git version 1.7 or later
-   XZ Utils 4.9 or later

## Check kernel dependencies

Docker in daemon mode has specific kernel requirements. For details,
check your distribution in installation\_list.

Note that Docker also has a client mode, which can run on virtually any
linux kernel (it even builds on OSX!).

## Get the docker binary:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
wget https://get.docker.io/builds/Linux/x86_64/docker-latest -O docker
chmod +x docker
~~~~

## Run the docker daemon

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
# start the docker in daemon mode from the directory you unpacked
sudo ./docker -d &
~~~~

## Giving non-root access

The `docker` daemon always runs as the root user, and since Docker
version 0.5.2, the `docker` daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a
TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user *root*, and
so, by default, you can access it with `sudo`.

Starting in version 0.5.3, if you (or your Docker installer) create a
Unix group called *docker* and add users to it, then the `docker` daemon
will make the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the *docker*
group when the daemon starts. The `docker` daemon must always run as the
root user, but if you run the `docker` client as a user in the *docker*
group then you don't need to add `sudo` to all the client commands.

> **warning**
>
> The *docker* group is root-equivalent.

## Upgrades

To upgrade your manual installation of Docker, first kill the docker
daemon:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
killall docker
~~~~

Then follow the regular installation steps.

## Run your first container!

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
# check your docker version
sudo ./docker version

# run a container and open an interactive shell in the container
sudo ./docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
~~~~

Continue with the hello\_world example.
